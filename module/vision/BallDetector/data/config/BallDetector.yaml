  print_status: false # either true or false; enable or disable printing of progress during the k-means and EM algorithms

  dist_mode: eucl_dist # specifies the distance used during the seeding of initial means and k-means clustering:
    # Parameters for dist_mode:
    # eucl_dist	   	Euclidean distance
    # maha_dist	   	Mahalanobis distance, which uses a global diagonal covariance matrix estimated from the training samples

  seed_mode: random_spread # specifies how the initial means are seeded prior to running k-means and/or EM algorithms
    # Parameters for seed_mode:
    # keep_existing	   	keep the existing model (do not modify the means, covariances and hefts)
    # static_subset	   	a subset of the training samples (repeatable)
    # random_subset	   	a subset of the training samples (random)
    # static_spread	   	a maximally spread subset of training samples (repeatable)
    # random_spread	   	a maximally spread subset of training samples (random start)
