  exposure: 33333             # The shutter time in microseconds (1/fps).
  gain: auto                  # The gain of the camera in dB.
  gamma: 1.25                 # For 8-bit gamma is applied as OUT = 255 * (IN/255)^1/gamma. If 0, gamma will be disabled to create a linear response.
  black_level: auto           # Analog black level (brightness) in percent. 0 = off.
  sharpness: auto             # For sharpness values greater than 1024, the pixel is sharpened; for values less than 1024 it is blurred. Averaged across a 3x3 block.
  hue: auto                   # Hue of the image in degrees.
  saturation: auto            # Saturation of the image in percent.
  white_balance: [   0,    0] # Adjust the relative gain of R/V w.r.t G/Y and B/U w.r.t G/Y. End goal is to achieve a 1:1:1 ratio for the RGB channels.
                              # [R_Value/V_value, B_Value/U_Value] .... A 0 in either position will turn on automatic control.
                              # For example, if the average pixel on the target was 222 (R), 232 (G), 236 (B) 
                              # then all the reds should be scaled up by 232/222 and the blues down by 232/236.
                              # According to technical reference, defaults are 1023 for both R and B. (These are 12 bit values).
